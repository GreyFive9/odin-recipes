            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <br>
            <h4>For the Balsamic Vinaigrette:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large serving bowl, combine the balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, Dijon mustard, garlic,
                    salt and pepper and whisk thoroughly together. While continuously whisking,
                    slowly pour in the olive oil until everything is incorporated.
                    The vinaigrette should be fully emulsified and coat the back of a spoon.
                    Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt and pepper as desired.
                    Cover the bowl and set aside until ready to use.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>For the Harvest Salad:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat grill to 425F. Remove steak from fridge one hour before cooking and let it come to room
                    temperature.</li>
                <li>Add the squash to the sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Add the thyme, ½ teaspoon kosher salt
                    and ¼ teaspoon black pepper.
                    Toss to coat and spread out in a single layer. Transfer to oven or grill and roast, flipping
                    halfway,
                    until the squash is fork-tender and slightly caramelized, around 40 minutes.
                    Remove squash from heat and tent with foil to keep warm or transfer to the top rack of your grill.
                </li>
                <li>Raise the heat to 500F</li>
                <li>Pat steak very dry with paper towel. Drizzle with avocado oil,
                    massage all over to coat and generously season both sides with salt and pepper.
                    Place onto the grill and cook, undisturbed with the lid closed, until grill marks form, around 5
                    minutes.
                    Flip and cook the other side until grill marks form or the thickest part of the steak registers 132F
                    for a medium-rare center.
                    Transfer steak to a board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.
                </li>
                <li>Add the arugula, shallots and grapes to the bowl with the vinaigrette and toss to coat. Arrange the squash on a serving platter. 
                    Top with the salad and sliced steak. Garnish with goat cheese and candied pecans. 
                    Serve warm or prepare all ingredients ahead of time and serve at room temperature.</li>
